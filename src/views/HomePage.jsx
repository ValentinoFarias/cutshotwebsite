/*
  HomePage — the composition seam for the whole site.

  T2 added the seven static sections; T3 adds the three client components. They
  slot into the ordered list below, in that order. Nothing here is a client
  component: everything is a server component unless it genuinely needs state.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Missing-asset convention (applies to every screenshot and the brand mark)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  None of the image files exist yet. Do NOT `import` a missing image — a static
  import of a file that is not on disk fails `next build`. Instead, each section
  that shows imagery keeps a component-local array with an `available` flag:

      const shots = [
        { src: "/screenshots/timeline.png", alt: "…", available: false },
      ];

  When `available` is false the section renders `.home__well-placeholder` with
  an HTML comment naming the screen that belongs there. Once the PNG is dropped
  into /public/screenshots, flipping the flag to `true` is the only change
  needed — no other edit anywhere.

  See Screenshots.jsx and Hero.jsx for the two live examples.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Landmarks
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <Navbar> renders the <header>, <Footer> the <footer>; both sit outside <main>
  so the landmarks are real. The single <h1> on the page belongs to <Hero>.
