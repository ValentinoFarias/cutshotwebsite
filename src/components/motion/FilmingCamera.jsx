  FilmingCamera — the pinned scene above the filming advice.

  As the section is pinned, the camera travels from a high overview of the
  whole court down to the one place the guide is asking for: centred behind
  the near baseline, about 3 m up on the back fence, with all four corners of
  the court in view. The instruction and the picture are the same sentence.

  Reduced motion, or no WebGL, and the block renders the static court with the
  spot marked and a plain caption. The advice is in the <dl> underneath either
  way — nothing here carries information that is not also written down.
