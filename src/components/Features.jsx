/**
 * Features — the six feature cards.
 *
 * Server component. The cards are written out rather than generated from a data
 * array because three of them carry real keycaps and one carries the colour-coded
 * stroke list; a data array would only hide that.
 *
 * Keycaps appear only where the app genuinely has a shortcut. Nothing here is
 * invented: the cards without a keycap simply do not have one.
 *
 * The five stroke colours are used in exactly one place on the site — the stroke
 * list below — and never as decoration. The stroke name is always spelled out, so
 * colour is never the only thing carrying the meaning.
 *
 * Two cards carry a small client-side diagram: <FrameStepper> in the player
 * card and <BallSpeed> in the ball-speed card. Both are aria-hidden and sit
 * BELOW the prose that already explains them.
