/**
 * HowItWorks — the four-step walkthrough, film to export.
 *
 * Server component. This section carries id="what-it-does", the destination of
 * the first navbar anchor: it is the first thing that answers the question, and
 * the feature grid follows immediately below it. The id exists nowhere else.
 *
 * The step numbers are CSS counters (see the HOW IT WORKS banner in style.css),
 * so the list stays an honest <ol> and there is no clipart anywhere near it.
 *
 * Two client components sit inside it and nothing else changed: <HowProgress>
 * draws the scrubbed rule across the four steps, and <KeycapSequence> shows
 * step 3's shortcuts pressing. Both are decorative and aria-hidden; the steps
 * read exactly the same with JavaScript off.
