/**
 * The court, once, in metres — the single source of truth for every drawing of
 * it on this page.
 *
 * Real ITF dimensions: 23.77 m long, 10.97 m wide doubles / 8.23 m singles,
 * service lines 6.40 m either side of the net, 1.07 m net at the posts.
 * The origin is the centre of the net; +z is towards the near baseline (the
 * end the phone films from).
 *
 * Plain data, no three.js import: the WebGL scenes and the static SVG fallback
 * both read this array, so they cannot drift apart.
